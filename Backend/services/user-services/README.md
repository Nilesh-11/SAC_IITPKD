### Workflow

### club roles
- `member` has lowest privilege of 1
- Club can add new roles of privilege in range of  5 to 80
- Head privilege is 99 and cohead is 98
- everytime the role is changed, `ex` is added as prefix to the current role and then new role is assigned. The privilege of `ex` role is one less than that of the current role
- Clubs cannot change or assign roles with privilege higher than 90, contact council
- Student has to first apply for a `member` role as /club/join
- If student is `ex-member`, then again apply for `member` to assign new custom roles
